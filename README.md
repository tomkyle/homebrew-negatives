# homebrew-negatives

This tap shall contain my tools for processing digital film negatives.

## Requirements

- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on your Mac - [Installationsanleitung auf deutsch](https://brew.sh/index_de.html)


## Install tap (optional) 


```bash
$ brew tap tomkyle/negatives
```

From [brew docs:](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/brew-tap.md)

> After that, `brew` will be able to work on those formulae as if they were in Homebrew's canonical repository. You can install and uninstall them with `brew [un]install`, and the formulae are automatically updated when you run brew update. 



## List of formulae

Well, not too much in here so far.
